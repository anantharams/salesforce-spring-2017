    Given a list of (int score, team name) tuples, and an integer min_score, 
    return a list consisting of only tuples where first score value is 
    greater than or equal to min_score AND if that team name is NOT in 
    the restricted_teams list.

    The final list must be sorted by score of the tuple, descending.

    Only return the top_n teams by score.

    HINT: List comprehensions, sorting, and slicing will be useful here!
